# Bloom-Study

The included notebooks were used to discover which species of plants have been blooming earlier and earlier every year.
The herb_flower_bloom notebook contains bloom data for multiple sites, while the Mohonk_bloom_data contains such data for one site, Mohonk.

I was asked to perform a linear regression on the day of first bloom vs. the year of the bloom. 
I was asked to compute the Kendall's tau, the R^2 of the regression, the slope of the regression line, and the p-values for the observed regressions. 
I was then asked to restrict results to instances that showed a p-value of <.1 and split these instances based on positive and negative slopes.

While further investigation is needed, we were able to identify many species of plants that showed a statistically significant relationship between the day of bloom and the increasing years.
